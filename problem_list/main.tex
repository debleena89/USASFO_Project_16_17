Related work: Language/automata-theoretic formulations of control perfor-
mence metrics have been studied in [?, ?]. The problem of characterizing dead-
line miss patterns under which control performence metrics like asymptotic sta-
bility is satisfied has been studied in [?]. Here, such a characterization has been
restricted to a ratio between the number of messages that meet their deadlines
to the number of messages that miss their deadlines. The problem we have
listed above will generalize such a result.
